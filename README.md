+ Project summary: 
In this project, we implemented two algorithms: memory-based algorithm, including Similarity Weight, Selecting Neighbours and Rating Normalization and model-based algorithm, including Cluster Models to conduct Collaborative Filtering. And we used two datasets, Anonymous Microsoft Web Data and EachMovie Dataset to evaluate and compare a pair of algorithms for collaborative ﬁltering (CF). For evaluation part, compare the performance for these diﬀerent algorithms and component combinations using  ranked scoring for dataset 1 and mean absolute error (MAE) and ROC sensitivity for dataset 2.
